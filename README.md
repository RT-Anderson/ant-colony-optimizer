Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm Written in Clojure
-----------
Overview
My favorite metaheuristic optimization algorithm written in Clojure to experiment with the language's concurrency features. 

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is my favorite algorithm because its elegance can be explained in a way anyone can understand.  The focus of this repository is to  implement ACO using FP best practices.  Feedback/suggestions are greatly appreciated and the code is available for anyone to use.
